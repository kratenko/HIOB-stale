  Eleven sequences selected from the tb100 data set, to probe
  possible tracker configurations without running the whole
  data set on it.
  
  Selection has been done so that each of the attributes given 
  by the creators of the data set is included at least thrice, 
  and thought has been put into it, to get a wide variaty.
  Most of the samples are relatively short, so that total 
  processing time is reduced, but also two long samples have
  been included, to keep long time performance in the process.
samples:
  - tb100/Ironman
  - tb100/MotorRolling
  - tb100/Suv
  - tb100/Surfer
  - tb100/Bird1
  - tb100/Deer
  - tb100/Trans
  - tb100/Bolt2
  - tb100/Freeman3
  - tb100/Panda
  - tb100/BlurCar3
